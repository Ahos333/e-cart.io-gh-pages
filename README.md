# E-Cart
E-cart is a multi-page e-commerce website.

## How to run the project:
- Click on this link: https://ahos333.github.io/e-cart.io-gh-pages/index.html

## Feature(s): 
- User can navigate to different pages (Home page, contact page, about page, shop page, sign in page, and sign up page) by clicking on the respective elements in the nav bar. For example, the "Home" link will take the user to 
the home section, the 'Shop' link will navigate to the shop section, and so on.

- Shop Page
  - Adding Items
    - User can add items to their shopping cart two ways:
      - Clicking on the "add to cart" button for the desired item
      - Clicking on the shopping bag icon onthe top right corner of the desired item
      - If you click on the desired item more than once, the user will receieve an alert letting you know the item is already in the cart.
      
  - Shopping Cart
    - On the shopping cart, the user can add (increment) or subtract (decrement) the cart item using the respective plus and minus icons.
    - Cart items can be removed two ways:
      - Clicking on the remove button.
      - Using the minus icon when there is only one item in the cart.
    - When the user has all of their desired items, the user can click the purchase button. An alert will appear letting the user know that there items were purchased and everything is removed from the shopping cart.

## Future Feature(s) (If the Project Were To Be Continued, How Would I Improve It?): 
- Moving the shopping cart to the menu (as a shopping cart icon)
  - Clicking on the shopping cart icon would open up a small page with all items in the user's cart.
  
- Adding More Functionality to Login and Sign-Up pages
  - Allowing users to register for an account.
  - Adding a database to store user's login information.
